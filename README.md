# MIT-things
Are you from MIT admissions and got directed to here? Great! If not, that's still cool, this is just a list of things that I've done, with some context.

<ul>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/GunnAeronautics/mower4.2.0>Rocket control code</a><br>This is the current version of the rocket control code. Mainly created at the end of my sophomore year of high school and further improved on throughout my junior year, the main advancements in this version were adding Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) support (so we know what the rocket is doing past just altitude) and making the code much more generalized, so more of it could be reused from year to year. The current plan is to turn most of this into a standalone library, which would allow anyone to run any rocket project they want off of this code and not just our TARC mechanisms. The next itaration of the actual controls behind this is still somewhat under developement, but will be a lot fancier and be able to focus on the actual control theory aspect of flight rather than just piping data from sensors directly to actuators. This was still a necessary step along the way, though.</li>
  <li><a href=https://github.com/GunnAeronautics/glider_control_demo>Glider control demo</a><br>Quick demo I threw together to see if I could actually process the data from the gyroscope into actuator outputs. TODO: I had a video of this working somewhere...</li>
